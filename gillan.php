<!--Child In Time-->
<h3>Child In Time - <em>1976</em></h3>
<p><img class="album_cover" src="imgs/i_cover_child_in_time.png" alt ="Child In Time Cover"/></p>
<p>Overall a very adventurous, experimental solo debut from Ian Gillan and his new band.  This album highlights his quirkiness and that's always a good sing.  Track highlights include 'Lay Me Down' with it's pumping bassline (John Gustafason), killer organ (Mike Moran) and a nice abstract guitar solo with plenty of meaty riffiness from Ray Fenwick.  'You Make Me Feel So Good' has Gillan yelping in fine form, and features nice slidework from Fenwick as well.  'Shame' is solid but 'My Baby Loves Me' doesn't develop much despite it's great guitar solo.  'Down the Road' is a bluesy ballad but there are too many multi tracked Ian's that get in the way of the idea although it probably sounded a lot trippier back in the day.  'Child In Time' kicks off the second side and gets things back on track.  Props to Ian for a completely original take on a Deep Purple staple.  He could have played it safe and done a straight reading but thankfully, that never was Ian's style!  This version is spacier, way more laid back and the guitar solo could not have been more radically different that Ritchie's, which is a smart move because not only would Ritchie's solo have been impossible to emulate, but Fenwick stays true to his strengths and plays to the song instead of trying to catch a ghost.  The album concludes with 'Let it Slide' which, unfortunately is long and episodic and just meanders through several uneventful landscapes with solos which, while they have a nice texture and tone, don't really develop much. It's pleasant enough harmonically, it's just a bit of a slog and feels like it was used to fill out the second side of the album.  <span>(rating: 4/5 shrieks)</span>

<!--Clear Air Turbulence-->
<h3>Clear Air Turbulence - <em>1977</em></h3>
<img class="album_cover" src="imgs/i_cover_clean_air_turb.png" alt="Clean Air Turbulence Cover"/>
<p>Another very experimental and restless album from Ian Gillan.  The Ian Gillan Band continues to lean into prog territory with the utilization of saxophones and trumpets and a generous amount of very cool keyboards sound.  The album title is derived From an aviation term describing sudden and severe turbulence in a cloudless region.  With so many stops and stutters and sudden shifts of mood and tempo, the title of this album and song of the same name is no accident.  'Five Moons' has a Weather Report feel to it.  'Money Lender' is jazzy hard rock, screamin' funk and heats up with great solos.  'Over the Hill' has high energy crescendos and maintains the funkiness found throughout the album with synths weaving in and out and abrupt changes in beat and timbre.  It's experimental and humorous breakdown includes some bizarre chanting from Ian Gillan.  'Goodhand Liza' is another off the "beaten" path foray while 'Angel Manchenio' wraps it all up with a dreamy layered intro, demented reggae and a heaping dose of funk.

<!--Scarabus-->
<h3>Scarabus - <em>1977</em></h3>
<img class="album_cover" src= "imgs/i_cover_scarabus.png" alt="Scarabus Cover">
<p>This album contains more upbeat rockers, much less prog and less emphasis on keys than the first two Ian Gillan Band albums.  Overall the album has a rootsier, rock n roll kind of vibe although it is obviously still the same band with funky grooves and jittery, proggy stops and starts (i.e. 'Poor Boy Hero.')  'Mercury High' is hard rocking boogie, in fact, there is a lot more 12 bar boogie on this album than on the band's previous two offerings.  'Mad Elaine' has terrific keys and hosts a nice guitar workout from Fenwick and Towns' keyboard parts are from outer space.  Overall this album is a more accessible but less exciting mixture of boogie, funk, jazz, rock, metal and and of course the obligatory Ian Gillan screeching.  Scarabus is a nod to the Deep Purple style but it just isn't quite on par with their best.

<!--Live At Budokon-->
<h3>Live at Budokan - <em>1977</em></h3>
<img class="album_cover" src= "imgs/i_cover_live_at_budokan.png" alt="Live at Budokan Cover">
<p>This is an excellent sampling of the live era of the Ian Gillan Band.  The Ian Gillan Band pushed and stretched the boundaries of the rock format as far as anyone could, incorporating elements of hard rock, jazz-rock, fusion and funk with Gillan's usual abstract lyrics, silly, nonsensical yet somehow usually charming lyrics.  There was never a dull moment with this band and the seemingly democratic input from musicians highly skilled at their craft makes a fan lament that this lineup was only together for a few short albums.  The most unfortunate part of this album is that there are 2 versions of 'Smoke on the Water' but this is also a testament to the talents of the band as the two versions are radically different from each other while sounding very little like the original Deep Purple version.  Likewise, interpretations of 'Child in Time' and 'My Woman From Tokyo' also pop up.  The Deep Purple covers might seem an easy and lazy choice but they actually go to show how restless and innovate Ian Gillan could be at his peak.

<!-- Mr. Universe -->
<h3>Mr. Universe - <em>1979</em></h3>
<img class="album_cover" src="imgs/i_cover_mr_universe.png" alt="Mr Universe Cover">
<p>A new lineup and new band as Ian Gillan changes the moniker from Ian Gillan Band to just plain Gillan.  The music gets a little more simplified as well.  Gone is much of the proggy excess that constituted the first three albums and in it's place is an overt emphasis on getting back to the rockin (and hard rockin at that!) In short, a return to his purply roots.  'Mr. Universe' is more of a headbanger with its focus on riffs centered around distorted guitars.  Even the muddier production screams a change in direction.  The 5 star songs are 'Secret of the Dance' which harkens back to 'Speed King' replete with dueling guitar vs keyboard. 'She Tears Me Down' is light but rocking and 'Roller' is a heavy, progressive song with a clever ending.  Thereafter it's a steep drop off, unfortunately.  'Mr. Universe,' the song,  just can't keep the momentum and flounders in a prolonged guitar wasteland which is a shame because the keys in that one are very interesting.  'Vengeance' is a generic rocker and 'Puget' sounds like Whitesnake on a bad day.  The keys save 'Dead of Night' with a tremendous solo.

<!-- Glory Road / For Gillan Fans Only-->        
<h3>Glory Road - <em>1980</em></h3>
<img class="album_cover" src="imgs/i_cover_glory_road.png" alt="Glory Road Cover"/>
<p>This album features a little more experimentation than 'Scarabus' and, as such, hearkens slightly back towards the Ian GIllan Band sound, but overall this is still a very riffy affair.  In many ways it's probably one of Gillan's more consistent albums but the rating is dragged down a notch as there aren't any songs that truly stand out.
<span>(rating: 3.5/5 shrieks)</span>
<p>The opening of <span class=FGFO>'For Gillan Fans Only'</span>is a bonus LP that was included with 'Glory Road'.  It's a short album that features a great deal of British, Monty Python-esque humor throughout.  A hefty dose of silliness and a sense of humor was what made Ian Gillan such a valuable addition to Deep Purple.  And for this album, the usual complicated mix of humor, prog and hard rock/avant - garde that seems to come so easily for Ian Gillan, really perks the the ears up.  This album is a little greater than the sum of it's parts.

<!--Future Shock -->
<h3>Future Shock - <em>1981</em></h3>
<img class="album_cover" src="imgs/i_cover_future_shock.png" alt="Future Shock Cover">
<p>Ian, as an artist, is nothing if not quirky and fun for the ears.  Even when he's bad, he's still pretty good and the great thing about Gillan is that he's never right down the middle.  On 'Future Shock' he is at his quirky solo best.  It's very nice mix of hard rock and psych.  Bernie consistently puts forth great solos that are almost enough to make you forget about Ritchie Blackmore for a minute but oops . . . when you open up the inner sleeve, there's a pic of a very young Ritchie back in his Outlaw days looking very goofy with an awkward smile.  I guess Ian just couldn't resist a stab at his old arch nemesis.  On this one 'No Laughing in Heavan,' 'Bite the Bullet,' 'If I Sang Softly' and 'For Your Dreams' make this a very strong solo effort from Ian Gillan.

<!-- Double Trouble-->
<h3>Double Trouble - <em>1981</em></h3>
<img class="album_cover" src="imgs/i_cover_double_trouble.png" alt="Double Trouble Cover">
<p>The vinyl version of 'Double Trouble' is a double album with one disc dedicated to new studio material and the other a sampling of live material.  It's a hard rocking studio effort with lots of classic soloing duels between Towns and Gers who consistently play well together and elevate each other to greater heights.  And for Gillan's part, there is even more shrieking than usual.  The tones can be dated, especially with the keyboards and the production is muddy but these flaws are easy to overlook because Gillan, always the shape shifter, always restless and experimental, offers daring song attempts, sometimes even verging on New Wave.  Imagine that!  Janick Gers is a steadying presence throughout, while he and Towns play ripping solos on "I'll Rip your Spine Out." Janick has a way of turning ordinary parts on "Restless" into something more magical and interesting.  "Sunbeam" features another wicked solo from Gers, this time on the outro.  The live album has great energy throughout and is a must for Purple fans.  Some great tracks are included and they all are delivered with the swagger of a very confident band.

<!--Magic-->
<h3>Magic - <em>1982</em></h3>
<img class="album_cover" src="imgs/i_cover_magic.png" alt="Magic Cover">
<p>On 'Magic' the songs are either pretty darn good or pretty darn boring without much in between.  The strong songs are 'What's the Matter,' which opens the album and roars out of the gate with some highly inventive guitar work from Janick Gers followed by "Bluesy Blue Sea" which has a good balance of Ian Gillan weirdness mixed in with listenability and coherence.  "Demon Driver" is just off the rails and completely demented musically and "Living a Lie" is offbeat and mellow in an other-worldly way.  'Living for the City' is a good choice for a cover, you can never go wrong with Stevie Wonder, and Ian Gillan sings his guts out on it.

<!--Accidentally On Purpose-->
<h3>Accidentally on Purpose - <em>1988</em></h3>
<img class="album_cover" src="imgs/i_cover_accidentally_on_purpose.png" alt = "Accidentally on Purpose Cover">
<p>After Deep Purple finished recording 'The House of Blue Light' album, Roger and Ian took a vacation to the Caribbean and used Sir George Martin's studio to record, presumably all of the ideas that were proposed to and dismissed by Ritchie Blackmore.  Roger and Ian both were probably brimming with ideas during the Deep Purple sessions but, once again, Ian Gillan was about to find himself and ex-member at Ritchie's behest and since Roger was always willing to do whatever it took to keep things moving smoothly, he never challenged Blackmore.  Therefore, they unloaded their coffers and the result was 'Accidentally on Purpose.'  It shouldn't be a surprise that there is nothing much in the way of the Deep Purple sound here.  It isn't much of a rocker but rather the product of two capable songwriters, freed from the restrictions of our favorite musical tyrant, on vacation, worried about their future role with Deep Purple and probably, in a healthy way, not really caring.  This album doesn't have anything truly memorable on it but it's not all that bad either.  Take it for what it is, competent artistic expression from a couple of guys who could finally take a deep breath, if only for a minute.

<!--Naked Thunder-->
<h3>Naked Thunder - <em>1990</em></h3>
<img class="album_cover" src= "imgs/i_cover_naked_thunder.png" alt="Naked Thunder Cover">

<p>Gillan found a ringer in Steve Morris, a helluva guitar player although his style is definitely of the era, his technique somewhere between Steve Vai and the hordes of Sunset Strip shredders.  A gifted guitar player no doubt, he adds a lot of excitement and spice to this album, especially on the song "Love Gun."  In spite of Morris' efforts the album is middle of the road solo work from Gillan.  Nothing overly memorable but nothing truly bad.

<!--Toolbox-->
<h3>Toolbox - <em>1991</em></h3>
<img class="album_cover" src= "imgs/i_cover_toolbox.png" alt="Toolbox Cover">
<p>'Toolbox' has a more updated production (for it's time) that sounds if Ian went shopping on Sunset Strip for a late 80's glam rock starter kit complete with Charvel Jackson, hairspray and spandex.  Honestly, the album starts off hot, and Steve Morris is a splendid guitar player but,  while it sounds interesting at first, it quickly wears out its welcome, becoming comical and then, finally, it's just all too much.  Kudos to Ian Gillan for trying something new, his imagination and experimentation makes him a legend, and, if it was high energy he was looking for he found it, he has even motivated himself on this album to take his yelping to a height that he would never able to recapture.  But alas, it just doesn't feel genuine.  The cool thing about classic Purple was how organic all of their tones were while riding the warp factor through outer space.  Sadly, this album blows up on launch.

<!-- Dreamcatcher -->
<h2>Dreamcatcher - <em>1997</em></h2>
<img class="album_cover" src= "imgs/i_cover_dreamcatcher.png" alt="Dreamcatcher Cover">
<p>There's bad news on all fronts with 'Dreamcatcher.'  If you like Ian Gillan because he's heavy and rocking you are definitely going to want to skip this one.  And if you really like music in general, likewise, you should skip it.  The opening track sets the tone with it's childish, nursery rhyme melodies and limp slide guitar work.  "You Sold My Love For a Song" follows, showing that Ian could sing jazzy numbers and sound pleasant enough, but the material he is working with is pretty bland overall and it feels more like an approach Gillan is toying with and not at all vested in.  Throughout this album Steve Morris continues shredding hair metal solos but with no regard to the soft nature of most of these songs.  His guitar solos sound out of place on this album but no matter, most of this album feels like a Lion King soundtrack gone horribly wrong.  About half way through you realize that the one or two really good songs that you've been waiting for are never going to show up.

<h3>Gillan's Inn - <em>2006</em></h3>
<img class="album_cover" src= "imgs/i_cover_gillans_inn.png" alt="Gillan's Inn Cover">
<p>This double album is an updated review of Gillan's career wherein he brings in a tons of guests to revisit his old material, and, happily, a lot of very interesting names pop up on the credits including Tony Iommi, Joe Satriani, Ronnie James Dio, Uli Jon Roth and of course, quite a few Deep Purple alumni to boot.  Old songs sound fresh again with updated production and Ian Gillan is quoted as saying this was the easiest record he ever made in his life.  Although every track isn't a winner, overall, this album does flow very easily from beginning to end.  Highlights include 'Unchain Your Brain,' 'Bluesy Blue Sea,' 'Trashed,' 'No Worries,' 'No Laughing in Heaven' and 'Loving On Borrowed Time.'  Demerits for the 10000th remake of 'Smoke On The Water.'  Here are some recognizable names that grace this album:  Don Airey, Ronnie James Dio, Joe Elliot, Janick Gers, Roger Glover, Jeff Healey, Tony Iommi, Jon Lord, Steve Morris, Steve Morse, Ian Paice, Uli Jon Roth, Joe Satriani, Mickey Lee Soule.

<!--One Eye To Morocco-->
<h2>One Eye to Morocco - <em>2009</em></h2>
<img class="album_cover" src= "imgs/i_cover_one_eye_morocco.png" alt="One Eye to Morocco Cover">
<p>Obviously, there is more to Ian Gillan than Olympic grade shrieking and especially as he gets older he seems to favor mellower moods on his solo offerings.  After 1990, most of his solo efforts are fairly pedestrian, and this is no exception.  A man of his status always manages to dip into a pool of very talented musicians for each of his projects (what else would one expect from a singer of his pedigree?) but the material, while interesting and usually imaginative, often lacks the elusive quality that makes a song truly memorable.  This album opens with the eponymous "One Eye To Morocco" which is moody and dreamy and has a nice melody.  "Change My Ways" is a highpoint as well, with some blistering harmonica, ripping guitars and excellent keyboard work, it's a song that gains energy as it goes along.  After that, everything is mediocre at best
