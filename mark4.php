Another major lineup change and another great album.  Somehow, this isn't shocking, Deep Purple always seems to find a way.  This time, the one to leave is Ritchie who went on to form Rainbow with Ronnie James Dio.  So how do you replace a guitar virtuoso who's fretboard work was the primary force behind the band?  Well, you just go get Tommy Bolin.  Seriously, what other guitarist could have come in and done that?  Unlike the classic MK II era, this band is funkier and more R&B driven, but it still sounds wild and exotic with Bolin's exceptional playing throughout.  The Glenn Hughes songs are the most satisfying i.e. 'Gettin' Tighter' and 'This Time Around,' the former with it's heavy, funky riff and jazzy middle section, the latter a gorgeous and inventive masterpiece of song development.  And man, can Glenn Hughes ever sing!!  The Coverdale songs tend to foretell the vibe of the upcoming Whitesnake era, bluesier, grittier but a little short on melody i.e. 'I Need Love,' 'Drifter,' and 'Lady Luck' brings the album down a star.  Coverdale does redeem himself however, with the closer 'You Keep On Movin,' which is sublime and elevated blues.

First of all, relegating Tommy Bolin to rank of cover guitarist, while unavoidable in this situation, is difficult to listen to.  Blackmore, by this point had played all of these songs so brilliantly on previous live versions that no one in the universe could step in and do them justice.  Bolin was a gamer, and it goes without saying, a brilliant guitarist in his own right, but listening to him try to paint by number his way through classic Deep Purple material (let alone on a Les Paul, egad!"  well, it's nowhere near as satisfying as hearing the live renditions of the material from 'Come Taste the Band'.  'Smoke on the Water' is a blessing and a curse for this band as obviously it and the other classics had to be played to placate the audience.  But the MK IV material is much more satisfying to listen to on this album.  Still, anything with Bolin on it, due to his short career, is essential.  After this tour, or part way through it, drugs would eat away at the heart and soul of this short lived lineup, leaving behind all of the untapped potential.  In fact, Deep Purple would remain quiet for 8 long years afterwards . . .
