Ritchie, was unhappy with the overall direction of Deep Purple during the making of 'Stormbringer,'. Simultaneously, he was smitten with the extraordinary vocal talents of the relatively unknown Ronnie James Dio (who was on the tour with Deep Purple, fronting the band Elf). Ritchie's mercurial nature always drove him to explore new directions.  He was also a bit of a vampire with an insatiable appetite for the fresh energy that new blood could inject into his projects.  All of this culminated into a powerful new project which he called Rainbow, evidently due to his hanging around at the Rainbow night club on the Sunset Strip.  Dio is an effortlessly, wonderful singer with rich, vocal tone to spare and when Ritchie is feeling rejuvenated he is at his best.  Herein is an album that dives into Middle Eastern modalities, Baroque themes and of course, heavy, hard rock.  The two boogie numbers drag this album down a bit and prevents it from being 5 star perfection but it's close. The record shows a bit of humor too, when at the end of 'If You Don't Like Rock and Roll' the small crowd in the studio applauds.  The 5 star songs are 'Man on the Silver Mountain,' 'Catch the Rainbow,' 'Snake Charmer,' 'The Temple of the King,' 'Sixteenth Century Greensleeves' and the album closer, the instrumental jammer, 'Still I'm Sad.'  An indispensable album for Deep Purple and Rainbow fans alike.</p>

<p class='review_text'>
<img class="album_cover" src="imgs/r_cover_rising.png" alt="Rising Cover"/>
'Rising' is the first of two perfect albums in a row for Rainbow.  Every song on this lp is brilliant.  New drummer Cozy Powell thunders away on the kit, Ritchie returns to a creative highpoint not seen since 'Burn,' and Ronnie James Dio esablishes himself as a metal goliath.   Tony Carey (keyboards) fires the opening salvo and then has a number of jaw dropping solos throughout. Jimmy Bain is a world class bassist whose track record speaks for itself.  This is a classic, loaded lineup stuffed with hall of fame talent and they produce a flawless record!  It's a pity that Ritchie refused to keep this lineup around for more than one album.  This band was every bit as talented and exciting as classic Deep Purple.</p>

Is this the best of the Rainbow studio albums?  That's arguable but this one definitely finds Dio, Blackmore and Powell at their artistic peaks.  The title track is high octane while 'Lady of the Lake' slithers along with hypnotizing slide work from Ritchie.  'LA Connection' has a swirling opening riff and plodding bass that captures a long, exhausting trek to the promised land of fool's gold.  'Gates of Babylon' is possibly the best guitar solo of Ritchie's career, perhaps tied with the solo from 'Child In Time' on 'In Rock' and this is from an exceptional lead guitarist who, let's face it, had a whole helluva a lot of terrific solos to choose from.  'Gates Of Babylon' ends with a very beautiful solo violin meandering and closing out the first side.  Side two opens with Cozy pioneering a proto speed-metal rhythm pulse that pushes 'Kill the King' to a whole new genre.  Blackmore fires his Strat like a kitted out machine gun.  In the middle, we have a nice jiggy middle 16 bar section that obviously caught Iron Maiden's ears.  The album concludes with the gorgeous, slightly out of context but nevertheless brilliant 'Rainbow Eyes' featuring Ronnie's wonderful voice, and tasteful and restrained guitar from Ritchie. There's not a dull moment on this album.  Essential!</p>

New lineup, new direction which is to say, same Blackmore.  Lyrically we have exited the realm of Dio's swords and dragons.  Mostly the album will focus on Bonnet's lyrics about sex and love with Glover chipping in the lyrics from 'Eyes of the World' and 'Lost in Hollywood.'  'All Night Long' pumps along due to Cozy's fantastic drumming and this song is poppy in a good, gritty way that few other bands can approach.  'Eyes of the World' sounds like Dio era Rainbow and Graham delivers but it's the killer guitar work that really makes this song stand out.  'Makin Love' has a beautiful harmonized guitar solo.  'Since You've Been Gone' is a legendary song with Hall of Fame worthy guitar solos.  'Love's No Friend' seems like another stab at 'Mistreated' but comes up well short.  'Danger Zone' has a very cool breakdown in the middle with a fantastic Blackmore vs Airey dual, evoking the sounds of classic Deep Purple.  Overall, this is an underrated and underappreciated Rainbow album, albeit with a couple of slow spots. </p>

At Ritchies's whim, Rainbow completes its transition from a dragon slaying metal band to an FM radio pop rock AOR format. A few songs actually manage to pull it off, but once again, the one's you really need, "I Surrender," "Spotlight Kid," "Can't Happen Here," and "Difficult To Cure" can be found on Finyl Vinyl, the essential Rainbow compilation album.  The rest of the songs on this album that were not mentioned, drag this album down.  A fun part of the album is being pranked by Ritchie with a locking track at the end of the record.</p>

At Blackmore's discretion, Rainbow morphs, almost overnight, from a metal, dragon-slayer style of music to an FM radio, pop rock AOR format. A few songs manage to pull it off, but once again, the one's you really need, 'I Surrender,' 'Spotlight Kid,' 'Can't Happen Here,' and 'Difficult To Cure' can all be found on Finyl Vinyl, the essential Rainbow compilation album.  The rest of the songs on this album that were not mentioned, only drag this album down.  A fun part of the album is being pranked by RB with a locking track at the end of the record.</p>

Poppy?  Yes.  Foreigner clones?  At best.  Survivor clones?  At worst.  It's still hard rock but the pop and gloss sheen just doesn't hold up for a full album.  Joe Lynn Turner tries to will some life into these songs and there are a handful of great Blackmore solos as usual but it's just not enough to be memorable pop and it's not hard enough or adventurous enough to be good hard rock.  It loses on both fronts.  The album starts promising with 'Stranded' and 'Can't Let You Go' and then much later in the album they hit a home run with 'Street of Dreams.'  The rest is entirely forgettable.  Skip this one, all the songs you need from here are on the essential Finyl Vinyl.</p>

And herein lies the last time Ritchie will rock.  His guitar playing is solid if not spectacular, that is a given no matter which recording or which era.  Likewise, his lineup will always consist of new members.  For 'Stranger In Us All' he starts up a whole new band, but even with all the fresh blood and the endless magic his guitar seems capabale of producing, it's not enough to rescure this album from being at best, very average.  There are a few exciting moments; the songs "Hunting Humans," "Black Masquerade" and "Silence" aren't legendary songs, but they are fun to listen to.  But every other track is a big drop off.  Doogie White is a good singer but he just doesn't quite measure up to the amazing vocalists that we're used to hearing Ritchie play with.  The same goes for the rest of the band: servicable, quality musicians, but no real magic.  As usual, the reason for a subpar outing from Ritchie is due to him having had one foot out the door.  This time his heart was set on working with his soon to be wife Candace and starting up their midievel folk career, which he would continue with until the current day.  Apart from a very short lived Rainbow tour in 2018, Ritchie's rock output was finished.  'Stranger In Us All' makes one wonder if, perhaps, that was for the best.</p>

If you want skip the full platter of Joe Lynn Turner era offerings and get the highlights, this is the album to get.  Most of the versions are live and more energetic than the studio counterparts.  Also, you get a Graham Bonnet and a couple of Ronnie James Dio numbers to boot on this double LP.  But what makes it indespensible are the "live" instrumentals "Difficult to Cure" and "Weiss Heim."  "Difficult to Cure" especially, is worth the purchase of the album alone.  Ironically, RB hated playing with the orchestra in the early days of Deep Purple, but thanks to Rosenthal's arrangements, doing so turns out to be one of his most exciting numbers of all time.</p>
