<p>Interestingly before Deep Purple became 'Deep Purple', they were originally called 'Roundabout' as the project was intended to be a band of revolving musicians with Chris Curtis of 'The Searchers' being the one constant member while playing the drums.  This was a short lived idea of Chris' who was never really in the band although he did his part by uniting Jon Lord with Ritchie Blackmore, thus forming the backbone Deep Purple.  Ironic then that Deep Purple has always been a revolving door of musicians and has hosted several different lineups through the years.  But fear not, for this never ending revolving door is made of legends, most of whom have also been in other amazing projects as well.  Through it's 40+ years and various personnel, it is surprisingly difficult to find anything but great offerings from these pioneers of hard rock.</p>

<p>This is where it all begins.  If you're looking for the songs that made them famous, you're not going to find them here, although 'Kentucky Woman' and 'Hush' were popular on the radio during the time.  This lineup is very much a product of the 60's, with it's psych trappings, odd, uneven mixes, heavy reliance on covers, rushed production deadlines and limited studio time.  This is Jon Lord's band, first and foremost, his organ leading the way into psychedelia with concertos and classical stylings mixed in with heavy rock elements.  Blackmore doesn't yet have his signature swagger on guitar although there are flashes of brilliance peppered in.  The most intriguing aspect of MK I is the depths of their progressiveness showcased on their third album, the eponymous 'Deep Purple.'  There's plenty of greatness on these early albums, but with a lineup change pending, they were soon to go from being quite good, to legendary.</p>

Their first album kicks off their career in fine fashion!  It's not quite stylistically prime Deep Purple (1972-1976). In fact the music created by the MK I lineup is prog-rock oriented and in the art-rock vein.  Underneath, one hears the dynamic interaction between Nick Simper (an underappreciated bassist) and drummer Ian Paice.  'Shades' biggest problem is its questionable mix.  Nick and Ian always cut through with excellent tone.  Ritchie Blackmore, however, tends to be buried in the mix (even with his generally thin and brittle tone.)  Although his playing is up to snuff in spots, it's not of the fiery, riffy excellence that would soon become his trademark.  Harmonically, he is inconsistent.  Rod Evans a strong vocalist, has a radically different singing approach than future vocalist (MK II) Ian Gillan which shows up strongly on 'Mandrake Root', a song which the band would keep in their repertoire even after Evans left.  Still, the pieces are in place and Lord and Blackmore are already pushing each other to greater heights; in short, trademark Deep Purple.  At this point Deep Purple is Jon's band and he takes the leading role on this album. There are a lot of fine ideas floating around on this debut but it's bogged down by a slower second side, mostly due to a lack of material and consequently, an over reliance on covers.  'And The Address' with it's rumbling keyboard intro, heavy guitar chords and guitar / keyboard interplay makes for an enticing opening number.  It's one of the best melodies on the album, ending with a lightening fast guitar flourish that serves as a harbinger to the classic Deep Purple sound.  'Hush' is the pop/hard rock organ driven tune that helped them gain popularity in the US.  'One More Rainy Day' is moody with classically tinged keys.  'I'm So Glad' starts a keyboard driven instrumental section until a mellow guitar kicks off the song properly.  'Mandrake Root' has a Hendrix-y riff but it never comes alive.  But it will in a few albums when Gillan starts yelping it in concert.  Still, it's memorable for it's chaotic, "freak out" improv vibe.

  Demerits for covering a Beatles song two albums in a row.  It's one too many times to the well and points to a big problem; lack of original material and an over reliance on covers.  Deep Purple is most exciting when they allow their creativity to flow.  Case in point is on 'Kentucky Woman,' an average song on it's own and a questionable choice for the band but what really stands out about this song is the manner in which the middle section de-evolves into a chaotic, psychedelic, freak out mess which, most likely, would have sent Neil Diamond running and screaming in the opposite direction if he ever listened to it.  'Listen Learn Read On' doesn't hold up well to repeated listenings despite a tremendous distorted bass solo from Simper.  The rest of the album leans toward a sophisticated kind of art-rock although  'Wring That Neck' would become a signature song for the band with not only a pseudo classical influence but hard rockin solos, inching the band closer to what they would soon become at their height.  With 'River Deep Mountain High' (another cover) the arrangement transcends the song, taking the Mk I lineup to a new high and setting the stage for the 3rd Deep Purple album which would be by far, the best album that this lineup produced.

  The self titled 'Deep Purple' is the crowning achievement of the MK I lineup, stacking up nicely alongside the best Deep Purple albums of all time.  Revealing yet another stylistic permutation that Deep Purple is capable of, this result is a blend of 60's pscyh, prog, high art, and heavy rock.  Finally, Blackmore is placed well in the mix and although at times his tone still suffers from thinness and a brittle wah, these negatives are displaced by his heavy opening riff and masterful soloing on 'Why Didn't Rosemary?'  'The Painter' also features fantastic solos from Lord and Blackmore both.  The album closes with Jon Lord getting one last shot at his classical aspirations and although most of his attempts (past and future) are clumsy, on this rare occasion, he knocks it out of the park.  'Deep Purple' is loaded with great solos and mysterious melodies  Ian Paice is a driving force in 'Chasing Shadows', his smooth and easy, jazzy yet rocking style, is always at the heart of Deep Purple.  The only questionable choice on this album is the decision to cover the ridiculous Donovan song.  If not for that, this album had a real shot at perfection.

I am basing this rating solely on the performance of the musicians and ignoring the shoddy recording quality which will undoubtedly be a huge turn-off for many.  Some may even find this artifact unlistenable.  Ultimately, we are lucky to have this souvenir of a live performance (and a very good one at that) from the MK I lineup.  The production has massive eq problems, distortion from clipping and an uneven mix (good luck making out the bass, which is a complete shame because Nicky was a damn fine player!)  Of course the bass drum is inaudible as well.  But the performances are great all the way around and this album feels more like classic Purple, due to the live setting, than any of the studio albums ever did.  This shouldn't be a surprise as this band always played with more energy live (especially Lord and Blackmore.)  Case in point: even 'Kentucky Woman' (such a dull choice for a cover) feels heavier and 'River Deep Mountain High' is a triumph.  Both outdo their studio counterparts.  It's a short set that's heavy on covers and while it's not essential, it's a helluva nice addition to your Deep Purple collection.  If you can find it, and don't mind the less than ideal production, get it!
