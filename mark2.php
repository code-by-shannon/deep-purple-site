The first truly essential Deep Purple album.  First off, make sure you find an overseas pressing so you you don't miss the long intro to 'Speed King' that the American release edited out.  It's a wonderfully chaotic opening that perfectly bookends the crazy atonal meltdown that concludes the album, the Mark II version of high art but this time served with a knuckle sandwich.  'Speed King' has, inarguably, the all time greatest Stratocaster vs Hammond B2 duel in recorded history.  It's jazzier vibe is nicely tucked away between the layers of mind melting hard rock.  The epic 'Child In Time' shows this band at the height of itself creative genius.  Gillan would never sing more dramatically than on this song, Lord has a moody, lovely and ominous organ intro, the song contains quite possibly Ritchie's best studio solo ever and the neoclassial riff doubled up by Lord to end Blackmore's solo is pure exhileration matched only by Gillans's encore vocal crescendos.  The entire album is consistently excellent albeit a minor complaint is that 'Bloodsucker,' 'Into the Fire' and 'Living Wreck' could have been shortened up a bit.  But this was assuredly a product of the 70's, and musical overindulgence from virtuosic instrumentalists who took pride in their craft was the order of the day, even if sometimes the song structure had to be relegated to secondary importance.  But let's not get too picky because 'Flight of the Rat' is an epic blast and 'Hard Lovin Woman' rocks until it finally loses control, crashes upside down, into the ditch, wheels still spinning, flames licking around the gas tank towards a catastrophic explosion.  But what a ride!<span class="yellow"> (rating: 5/5 whammy bars)</span></p>

Originally released as 'Scandanavian Nights', 'Stockholm 1970' has been cleaned up and the songs have been put in the correct order (except for a couple of bonus tracks from different concerts mixed in between - which is a bit frustrating).  Skip over the bonus tracks if you can and listen to the concert in order and in it's entirety.  This album is essential due to the fantastic early MK II material that won't show up again like 'Into the Fire,' 'Wring that Neck,' 'Speed King,' and 'Mandrake Root.'  'Into the Fire' is heavier here than on 'In Rock' and is a must listen while 'Speed King' stretches out, employing fantastic dynamics and containing an early version of the classic Ian - Ritchie call and response that would remain a staple of their live performances for years.  'Wring That Neck' and 'Mandrake Root' both take up an entire side of an album.  Gillan introduces 'Wring That Neck' and could have gone to the pub next door for a beer while the band jammed away (something he was know to have done at least once during one of Blackmore's extended guitar solos.)  'Stockholm' allows you to experience first hand Deep Purple's imagination, self indulgence and seemingly limitless atonal, space rock, fusion-istic predilections, boundless and executed to great effect.  No other band can kick you into the musical black hole event horizon.  Good luck returning from your altered reality!<span class="yellow"> (rating: 5/5 whammy bars)</span>

A strange kind of album in many ways.  Sandwiched in between the DIY anarchic avalanche of 'In Rock' and the sophisticated yet accesible hard rocking of 'Machine Head,' 'Fireball' is their artistic statement.  It is just as improvised as 'In Rock' but the chaos is replaced with a roominess and laid back vibe.  What's most noticeable is that 'Fireball' doesn't showcase Jon Lord rocking his organ until it tips over onto the floor in a crash of reverb, nor Blackmore wrecking his Strat or even Ian yelping into the cosmos.  But rather, it is a mellower album, as far as hard rock standards will allow.  'Fireball' is the opener, kickstarted by the drumming of Ian Paice. The trippy, backwards slide guitar work of Ritchie on 'NoNoNo' is mesmerizing while 'Strange Kind of Woman' is classic Deep Purple pop (as FM friendly as DP could be expected to manage.)  'The Mule' is a great combo of vocals and instrumental prowess.  A couple of great songs didn't make this album in America, 'Demon's Eye' and 'I'm Alone' the latter featuring some blistering solos from Ritchie and Jon.  If they would have made some tough editing decisions and managed to include these two tunes, I think they would have had another perfect album in their catalogue.  As it is, it misses by the width of a high e string, mainly due to the goofiness of 'Anyone's Daughter', which although fun and spirited from Ian Gillan, is unessential.<span class="yellow"> (rating: 4.75/5 whammy bars)</span>

If you are only going to add one DP studio album in your collection, this is probably the one you need.  Herein lies the original version of 'Smoke on the Water' which contains not only an instantly recognizable iconic Blackmore riff but one of the most well crafted guitar solos of his career as well.  The vocal melodies are consistently excellent by Ian Gillan allowing this album to surf seamlessly and simultaneously between pop and underground hard rock.  Where 'In Rock' was punkish and anarchic in nature, 'Machine Head' is lean, and refined but loses none of the exciting energy that went into 'In Rock.'  The fiery interplay between Lord and Blackmore is on constant display in 'Highway Star' and 'Lazy.' There's avant-garde metal for the cosmos in 'Space Truckin' with Ian Paice's prolonged drum break leading into an anarchic ascension.  Decorating the album throughout are Gillan's unearthly yowls.  Even the filler songs aren't filler, 'Pictures of Home' was released as the single. 'Never Before' has a great moody breakdown.  This album is essential as evidenced by half of the material on the album being included in the bands live show ever since it was released.<span class="yellow"> (rating: 5/5 whammy bars)</span></p>

This is the definitive hard rock concert recording from the 70's.  Recorded as an afterthought and with little interest in the project from the band (aside from Glover who did the mixing) it captures the band, "road hot" and at their peak.  Another remarkable fact about this album other than the music and musicianship, is that there are no overdubs. Gillan was fighting a cold and hence he can be heard croaking on occasion if you really listen, and Ritchie flubs a few notes here and there (again if you really listen) but none of that is important because this is an album about artists pushing their songs, their musicianship and their imagination to the limits.  The solos are self indulgent, of course, this was hard rock in the 70's afterall, a response to the limiting 2 minute song format of the 50's and 60's.  All of the songs are from the exalted trinity of 'In Rock', 'Fireball' and 'Machine Head' and in many ways they are superior to their studio counterparts.  Of course this is essential Deep Purple.  The remastered CD contains the encores 'Black Night,' 'Speed King' and 'Lucille' and if you're really serious (and well you should be) you can find the box set which contains all 3 nights in Japan from which the original 'Made in Japan' was culled.<span class="yellow"> (rating: 5/5 whammy bars)</span>

First off, this album is not terrible even though critics have panned it as a product of it's background: exhaustion and sickness from relentless touring as well as the insurmountable and growing rift between Blackmore and Gillan who, by this point, refused to even be in the studio together at the same time.  Does all of this make for a bummer of an album?  Kind of.  Ultimately, Ritchie was getting the itch to go in a bluesier direction, as he was smitten with Paul Rodgers' vocal style.  In line with his mercurial nature, he wanted to shake up the lineup and the musical direction again.  When Ritchie has his heart elsewhere it can mean passionless solos like the one we get on 'Super Trouper.'  However, there are still many great moments:  'My Woman From Tokyo' is no doubt a classic Deep Purple song with a signature Blackmore riff and surreal bridge.  Rarely do we get to hear Jon Lord play piano so quietly and prettily, and rarely do we get to hear Gillan show such melodic range and restraint.  'Smooth Dancer' has good energy and it's funny that Gillan wrote the lyrics that so obviously disparage Ritchie's character.  Either Blackmore didn't notice, or more likely, couldn't even be bothered to care.  Paice's drumbeat is where the title 'Rat Bat Blue' comes from, according to Gillan and features the typically effortless drumming that gives disparate song parts fluidity, nimbly linking them together. 'Rat Bat Blue' also features an amazing if not comically over the top solo from Jon Lord.  'Our Lady' actually has some interesting Hendrix inspired R&B rhythm work form Ritchie (Hendrix was one of the few guitarists that even Ritchie would admit to admiring) as well as some very nice melodic development from Gillan adding depth with Beatlesque background harmonies and cool synthy sounds from Lord.<span class="yellow"> (rating: 3.5/5 whammy bars)</span>
